Scion is a 2D game library made in rust.

## Why this project ? 

Well, firstly because it was a good way to learn. 
Then because a lot of projects these days focus on adding a lot of feature pretexting feature parity with big editors. 
Here we focus on the features that we really need for our projects. We won't add things just because they are cool, but because we need them in 
a game project


Scion relies on a short list of principles that also serves as a guideline: 

- Strong focus on **2D** only.
- **Easy** and **Fun** to use.
- Clean and readable source code.
